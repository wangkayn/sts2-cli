# STS2-CLI Bug Tracker

## [FIXED] BUG-001: Potion index shifts after use, causing invalid index errors (2026-03-22, fixed 2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: combat_play
- **Description**: After using a potion at index 0, remaining potions shift indices but the old indices are still referenced.
- **Fix**: Changed verification from index-based check to reference-based `Contains(potion)` check in `DoUsePotion`.
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs:~775

## [FIXED] BUG-002: Potion use_potion fails silently for some potion types (2026-03-22, fixed 2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: combat_play
- **Description**: Potions with TargetType.None/All (Attack Potion, Fortifier, Lucky Tonic) had incorrect auto-targeting.
- **Fix**: Removed catch-all else branch that forced `target = player.Creature`. Now only Self/AnyEnemy get auto-targets; others correctly leave target as null.
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs (DoUsePotion auto-targeting)

## [FIXED] BUG-014: Vantom R3 end_turn deadlock from Cmd.Wait in StatusCard intent (2026-03-22, fixed 2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: combat_play (end_turn during Vantom boss Round 3)
- **Description**: Vantom's DISMEMBER_MOVE adds 3 Wound status cards via CardPileCmd.AddToCombatAndPreview(), which calls Cmd.Wait(1f) for UI preview animation. In headless mode, Cmd.Wait never completes (no Godot scene tree), blocking the ActionExecutor, preventing WaitUntilQueueIsEmpty from completing, preventing StartTurn from firing, causing _turnStarted event to never set.
- **Fix**: Harmony patch on both Cmd.Wait() overloads to return Task.CompletedTask immediately (no-op in headless mode).
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs (PatchCmdWait, YieldPatches.CmdWaitPrefix)

## [FIXED] BUG-015: Self-targeting potions (Flex, Fortifier) applied to enemies when target_index provided (2026-03-22, fixed 2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: combat_play (use_potion)
- **Description**: DoUsePotion checked target_index before TargetType, so Self-targeting potions like Flex Potion would target enemy at index 0 instead of the player.
- **Fix**: Check potion.TargetType first — Self/TargetedNoCreature always targets player regardless of target_index.
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs (DoUsePotion)

## [FIXED] BUG-016: Rest site HEAL creates infinite rest_site loop (2026-03-22, fixed 2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: rest_site (choose_option for HEAL)
- **Description**: After choosing HEAL, rest site options didn't clear, so DetectDecisionPoint returned rest_site again.
- **Fix**: After non-Smith rest options, force transition to map via ForceToMap().
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs (DoChooseOption rest site handler)

## [OPEN] BUG-003: EOF crash during Leaf Slime combat (2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: combat_play
- **Description**: Simulator occasionally crashes (returns EOF) during combat with Leaf Slime groups, possibly related to slime splitting mechanics or card interactions during split.
- **Repro**: Fight Leaf Slime group with seed=silent_run_3
- **Reported by**: Silent agent
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs (combat resolution)

## [FIXED] BUG-022: Self-targeting cards fail when target_index provided (2026-03-22, fixed 2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: combat_play (play_card)
- **Description**: DoPlayCard checked target_index BEFORE card.TargetType. When a Self/None/All card (Defend, Powers) was played with target_index:0, it resolved to an enemy target instead of null, causing PlayCardAction to fail silently.
- **Fix**: Check card.TargetType first — only AnyEnemy cards use target_index. All other cards get target=null (game handles targeting internally).
- **Impact**: This was likely the root cause of most "Card could not be played" errors throughout 10+ iterations.
- **Verified**: Using log replay (step 8 of seed 970fd80347ca) — Defend with target_index:0 now succeeds.
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs (DoPlayCard target resolution)

## [FIXED] BUG-004: Cards reported as can_play=true infinitely, causing infinite play loop (2026-03-22, fixed 2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: combat_play
- **Description**: PlayCardAction failing silently left card in hand, causing infinite play attempts.
- **Fix**: Added post-play verification in DoPlayCard — if card is still in hand at same index after action, returns error "Card could not be played" instead of looping.
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs (DoPlayCard)

## [OPEN] BUG-005: game_over state reports hp == max_hp even when player died (2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: game_over
- **Description**: The game_over JSON response shows player.hp equal to player.max_hp (e.g. 80/80) even when the player died. The actual HP at death is not captured.
- **Reported by**: Ironclad agent (iteration 2)
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs (GameOverState / PlayerSummary)

## [OPEN] BUG-006: Regent Particle Wall card can_play=true but fails to play (2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: combat_play
- **Description**: Particle Wall (Regent card) reports can_play=true but when played returns "Card could not be played (still in hand after action)". May require special target or condition not captured by can_play.
- **Reported by**: Regent agent (iteration 2)
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs (card play handling)

## [OPEN] BUG-007: Regent Astral Pulse StarCostTooHigh despite can_play not checking (2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: combat_play
- **Description**: Astral Pulse reports StarCostTooHigh error, suggesting can_play doesn't fully account for star cost requirements.
- **Reported by**: Regent agent (iteration 2)
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs (card play validation)

## [FIXED] BUG-008: Map/context missing boss encounter name (2026-03-22, fixed 2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: map_select / all decisions
- **Description**: Boss node in map data and RunContext had no boss name/type info, only "Boss" label.
- **Fix**: Added boss encounter extraction from Act.BossEncounter, with localized name via Monster() lookup. Boss info now in both get_map response and every decision's context field.
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs (GetFullMap, RunContext)

## [FIXED] BUG-009: BBCode tags in card/relic descriptions (2026-03-22, fixed 2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: all
- **Description**: Card and relic descriptions contained raw BBCode tags like [gold], [/blue], [b], [sine].
- **Fix**: Added StripBBCode() to LocLookup.Bilingual() that strips all BBCode tags.
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs (LocLookup class)

## [FIXED] BUG-011: NullReferenceException on select_map_node after leaving shop (2026-03-22, fixed 2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: map_select
- **Description**: After leaving shop, selecting an Elite node causes NullReferenceException.
- **Fix**: 4 changes: (1) DoMapSelect uses direct EnterMapCoord instead of action executor, (2) null check for player.Creature in DetectDecisionPoint, (3) null check for map.GetPoint in MapSelectState, (4) WaitForActionExecutor after EnterRoom in DoLeaveRoom.
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs

## [FIXED] BUG-012: Boss name/ID empty in context.boss throughout entire run (2026-03-22, fixed 2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: all decisions
- **Description**: `context.boss.name` was empty because code used non-existent `BossId` property.
- **Fix**: Changed `_runState.Act?.BossId.Entry` to `_runState.Act?.BossEncounter?.Id?.Entry` in both RunContext and GetFullMap. Also restructured output to `{id, name}` dict.
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs (lines ~1990, ~2670)

## [OPEN] BUG-017: Silent Slice card deals 0 damage (2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: combat_play
- **Description**: Slice card (0-cost Attack) deals 0 damage consistently. Multiple agents confirmed.
- **Workaround**: Never pick Slice.

## [OPEN] BUG-018: Precise Cut displays wrong damage (2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: combat_play
- **Description**: Precise Cut shows 13 damage in stats but only deals 3-5 actual damage.
- **Workaround**: Don't rely on displayed stats for this card.

## [OPEN] BUG-019: Phantom Blades unreliable auto-trigger (2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: combat_play
- **Description**: Phantom Blades power doesn't trigger reliably on enemy attack turns.
- **Workaround**: Don't pick this card.

## [OPEN] BUG-020: Danse Macabre end-of-turn damage doesn't apply (2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: combat_play
- **Description**: Danse Macabre power supposed to deal end-of-turn damage but confirmed unreliable in simulator.
- **Workaround**: Don't rely on this for damage scaling.

## [OPEN] BUG-021: Doom Potion doesn't tick damage (2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: combat_play
- **Description**: Doom Potion applies 33 Doom but damage never ticks during boss fight.
- **Workaround**: Don't rely on Doom for boss kills.

## [OPEN] BUG-013: Relic picking session conflict on room transition (2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: map_select
- **Description**: "InvalidOperationException: Attempted to start new relic picking session while one was already occurring!" on floor 12→13 transition. May occur when entering Treasure room or room with relic rewards before previous relic session completes.
- **Reported by**: Ironclad agent (iteration 3)
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs (DoMapSelect / TreasureState)

## [FIXED] BUG-010: Vantom boss EndTurn deadlock (2026-03-22, fixed 2026-03-22)
- **Decision type**: combat_play (end_turn during Vantom boss fight)
- **Description**: Simulator deadlocked during EndTurn in Vantom boss fight. Task.Yield() posted continuations to ThreadPool that never completed.
- **Fix**: Re-enabled PatchTaskYield() Harmony patch (was commented out). Added targeted SuppressYield=true only during EndTurn (try/finally), disabled during map navigation. This forces Task.Yield() continuations to run inline synchronously during enemy turn processing.
- **Verification**: 15/15 regression runs pass (all 5 characters × 3 runs), 0 timeouts.
- **Relevant code**: Sts2Headless/RunSimulator.cs (DoEndTurn, EnsureModelDbInitialized, YieldPatches)
